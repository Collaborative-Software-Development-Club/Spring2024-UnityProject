-- CURRENT VERSION: 0.9 --

Initial release

This version contains many buildings, textures and objects/props to help you build out some really great scenes. There is an "Prefab Creation" scene which showcases all the prefabs in the package, and allows you to more easily create your own.

We will be adding more content to the package over time, including based on suggestions we get from our active users on our Discord channel (https://discord.gg/NP7YbM)

IMPORTANT: Create your own original prefabs by copying ours and moving them, or dragging them from the scene into the project and select "Original Prefab". This way, when we update our main prefabs, what you've created won't be affected.


-- TREES, ROCKS, AND OTHER ITEMS --

There are so many amazing environment packs on the Asset Store that contain rocks, trees, and other essential items. I knew I could never make anything that matches that quality, and it would make no sense for me to spend time and money doing so.

Instead, I encourage all users to find the right trees, rocks, and other key items for the specific project they're working on.

These are the assets we've used in the main demo scene:

Forest Environment - Dynamic Nature: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/forest-environment-dynamic-nature-150668?aid=1100lxWw
Ian's Fire Pack: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/fire-explosions/ian-s-fire-pack-69661?aid=1100lxWw
Forest Birds: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/animals/forest-birds-134407?aid=1100lxWw
Flow - the voice of rivers: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/ambient/nature/flow-the-voice-of-rivers-41603?aid=1100lxWw


-- TEXTURES --

To save resources, the package re-uses textures as much as possible, and combines common texture types (Wood, props, etc) on 4k texture sheets. Currently some of the sheets may have empty space. This will be filled in future updates with additional props and objects.


-- PREFABS / DOORS / WINDOWS --

The prefabs for doors and windows often will have many door options at once. Most will use the "Prefab Child Manager" script which makes it easy to activate or deactivate children, at run time and in the inspector. This can be coded, and even randomized at runtime.

Most buildings should already have the door/window prefabs attached. They use nested prefabs, so if you change the underlying prefabs, all buildings will be affected.

Best practice is to save a new prefab for every building that you don't want to change if an underlying prefab is changed.
